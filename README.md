Car Park System


A car park has a single lane that holds up to certain fixed number of vehicles.(here I’ve only created three spaces for simplicity).
vehicles arrive from east gate and leave from west gate. 
Since there’s only one lane, if a car in the middle takes out, vehicles in front should move out and after it leaves vehicles move back.
When a car arrives, system first checks for an empty space.
If there’s no space, car should wait for a space to clear. 
When an empty spot arise, waiting list automatically moves forward and fills the spot.
